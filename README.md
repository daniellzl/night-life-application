### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app).

1. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

2. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

3. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

4. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

5. Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
